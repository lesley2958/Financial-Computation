# Financial-Computation
MongoDB Database - Financial Computation. 

<b> Usage:</b>

This database was created using PyMongo. Using modules to read in the excel files, I transferred all the table data to the database.

Format: 

There are five main collections, each one corresponding to a different excel file. Each collection is actually an array of collections that correspond to the different sheets within that excel file.
